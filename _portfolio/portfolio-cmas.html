I completed my three-month Master of Research project in the Credgington group (Optoelectronics group). I investigated how molecular modifications changed the photophysics of a class of organometallic emitters known as carbene-metal-amides (CMAs). CMAs are a fascinating class of emitter due to the unprecedented speed and efficiency at which they harvest usually dark triplet excitons for light emission. This process occurs through thermally-activated delayed fluorescence and is enhanced due to the spin-orbit coupling afforded by their metal centres. Probing the effect of molecular modifications involved characterising the photophysical properties of the emitters using steady-state and time-resolved experiments. My work from this project features in [Chemical Science](https://bdoptoelectronics.github.io/publication/2020-cma-colors) and [Chemistry of Materials](https://bdoptoelectronics.github.io/publication/2019-05-28-dendritic-cmas).
