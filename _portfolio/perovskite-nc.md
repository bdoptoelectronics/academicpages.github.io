My two-month research project was part of an on-going collaboration between the [Catalysis & Process Integration Group](https://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/process-integration-group) and [Stranks Lab](https://www.stranks.oe.phy.cam.ac.uk/), Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Cambridge. Perovskite nanocrystals are efficient light emitters for LEDs. Typically, solution-processed perovskite nanocrystals are limited by batch synthesis techniques. We explored how continuous flow reactor systems can be used to synthesise perovskite nanocrystals with the aim to achieve improved monodispersity and greater throughput. I designed and 3D printed a flow reactor then characterised the basic photophysical properties of the nanocrystals. Our collaborators used STEM-HAADF (pictured) to confirm the size and shape of the nanocrystals.
