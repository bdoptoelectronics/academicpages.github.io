During my MPhys project in 2017 I carried out research in the [Photon Science Institute](https://www.psi.manchester.ac.uk/), University of Manchester using electron microscopy to investigate the role of different types of defects present in multicrystalline silicon solar cells. The project involved sample preparation including lithography and working in a class 100 cleanroom. We designed a mechanical and electronic adaptation to the SEM that would allow for electron beam-induced current studies of disassembled solar cells. Monte Carlo simulations were used to provide theoretical models of the potential experimental work.
