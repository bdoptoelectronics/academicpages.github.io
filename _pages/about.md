I am a second-year PhD student in the [Optoelectronics group](oe.phy.cam.ac.uk), Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge and visiting student at [CAESR](http://caesr-web.chem.ox.ac.uk/home), University of Oxford. Currently, I am investigating the spin and photo-physics of new organic emitters for OLEDs, with a focus on transient electron spin resonance, time- and temperature-resolved laser spectroscopy, and accurate quantum efficiency measurements.

I studied Physics as an undergraduate at the University of Manchester before joining the Cambridge [NanoDTC](https://www.nanodtc.cam.ac.uk/) MRes+PhD program in 2017. After completing my Masters of Research long-project in the Optoelectronics group I decided to stay in the group to pursue my PhD. I have always been strongly interested in researching the physics of semiconducting materials, this is reflected in my [research experience](https://bdoptoelectronics.github.io/portfolio/), which spans from electron microscopy of silicon solar cells to ultrafast spectroscopy of small organic molecules for LEDs.
