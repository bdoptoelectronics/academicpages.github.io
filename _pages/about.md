I studied Physics as an undergraduate at the University of Manchester before joining the Cambridge [NanoDTC](https://www.nanodtc.cam.ac.uk/) MRes+PhD program in 2017. After completing my Masters of Research long-project in the Optoelectronics group, Cavendish Laboratory I decided to stay in the group to pursue my PhD. I investigate the spin and photo-physics of new organic emitters for OLEDs, with a focus on transient electron spin resonance, time- and temperature-resolved spectroscopy, and accurate efficiency measurements.
