excerpt: 'Harnessing the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum is exceedingly important for photovoltaics, telecommunications, and the biomedical sciences. While thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted much interest due to their intense luminescence and narrow exchange energies, they are still greatly inferior to conventional fluorescent dyes in the NIR, which precludes their application. This is because securing a sufficiently strong donor−acceptor interaction for NIR emission alongside the narrow exchange energy required for TADF is highly challenging. Here, we demonstrate that by abandoning the common polydonor model in favor of a donor−acceptor dyad structure, a sufficiently strong donor−acceptor interaction can be obtained to realize a TADF emitter capable of photoluminescence close to 1000 nm. Electroluminescence at a peak wavelength of 904 nm is also reported. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a new approach to the development of future NIR TADF materials.'

Harnessing the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum is exceedingly important for photovoltaics, telecommunications, and the biomedical sciences. While thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials have attracted much interest due to their intense luminescence and narrow exchange energies, they are still greatly inferior to conventional fluorescent dyes in the NIR, which precludes their application. This is because securing a sufficiently strong donor−acceptor interaction for NIR emission alongside the narrow exchange energy required for TADF is highly challenging. Here, we demonstrate that by abandoning the common polydonor model in favor of a donor−acceptor dyad structure, a sufficiently strong donor−acceptor interaction can be obtained to realize a TADF emitter capable of photoluminescence close to 1000 nm. Electroluminescence at a peak wavelength of 904 nm is also reported. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a new approach to the development of future NIR TADF materials.
